## Twitch Games Data Analysis

In this project, I analyzed data from the popular streaming platform, Twitch, for the years 2016-2023. I cleaned the data and proceeded to analyze it in SQL which can be found here.

The interactive dashboard can be found here.

Twitch and game/category explanation can be found here.

Twitch growth during pandemic years

* We see an exponential growth of Twitch being used between 2019-2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic with a staggering 121% growth between those years.
* If you look at data from 2020, we see a sharp rise in usage between March and April which is the start of the pandemic. As the weather gets warmer and COVID cases go down, we also see a dip in usage before picking up again in the colder months when COVID begins its second wave after people have gathered for the holidays. In 2021 we see Twitch usage increase after every wave when restrictions go in place and dip as cases go down. There is an overall decrease in usage in 2022 as most of the COVID restrictions lift and cases have plummeted.
* The top game/category is Just Chatting with 9.053B total hours watched. Though Just Chatting was only incorporated in late 2018, it quickly overtook all other games/categories and by May of 2020 consistently becomes the number one most watched cateogry on Twitch (per month).
* The top ten games are all multiplayer online games, except Just Chatting.
* During the pandemic, the two game/categories that had the largest increase in hours watched was Just Chatting and GTA V which both have highly social elements compared to other multiplayer games. Just Chatting can be a range of reacting, storytelling, interviewing, podcasts, etc. while GTA V 

How can Twitch continue to increase viewership after the pandemic years?

* There is still a huge gender gap within the Twitch audience with only 20.2% of the viewers identifying as female. Are there ways to increase female Twitch viewership by incorporating new categories?
